ABOUT YAHTZEE

Yahtzee is a dice game based with a poker twist. The objective of the game is to
the score the most points by rolling dice to make certain combinations. There
are 13 possible combinations.  Each combination can only be used once. The game
ends when you have filled in all the slots on the scoreboard.

One game consist of 13 rounds. Each round, player rolls 5 dice. You can roll up
to three times in each round, choosing to roll some or all of the dice each
time. However, the player is not required to roll the dice three times if a
combination is achieved earlier. Scoring the roll ends a round.

The score is determined by a different rule for each category.


GAMEPLAY

To start, roll all five dice by clicking on the "Roll" button. After you roll
the dice, you can score the current roll, or re-roll any or all of the five
dice. Scoring the roll ends the current round.

To re-roll some of the dice, select the dice you want to hold and re-roll with
the "roll-dice" button.  This will re-roll the unselected dice, leaving the
selected ones unchanged.

You can roll the dice a total of three times -- the initial roll (in which you
must roll all the dice), plus two re-rolls of any or all dice. After rolling
three times, you MUST score the roll.

Once you've scored the roll, you roll all the dice again and repeat the process.
You continue until all 13 categories have been filled, at which time the game is
over.
