GAME OBJECTIVE
Yahtzee is a dice based game with a poker twist. The objective of the game is to
roll dice to ge the highest scoring combinatrion for 13 winning combinations.
Each combination can only be used once. The game ends when the Player has had an
attempt to  fill in all the slots on the scoreboard.

One game consist of 13 rounds. Each round, the player rolls 5 dice 1-3 times
until a winning combination is achieved. Once a combination is achieved, the
player marks the scoreboard. Marking the scoreboard ends the round.

SCORING  
The score is determined by a different rule for each category The
scoring categories have varying point values, some of which are fixed values and
others where the score depends on the value of the dice. A Yahtzee is five-
of-a-kind and scores 50 points, the highest of any category. The winner is the
player who scores the most points.


HOW TO PLAY 
To start, roll all five dice by clicking on the "Roll" button. After
you roll the dice, you can mark the scoreboardl, or re-roll any or all of the
five dice. Marking the Scoreboard ends the current round.

To re-roll some of the dice, select the dice you want to hold and re-roll with
the "roll-dice" button.  This will re-roll the unselected dice, leaving the
selected ones unchanged.

You can roll the dice a total of three times -- the initial roll (in which you
must roll all the dice), plus two re-rolls of any or all dice. After rolling
three times, you MUST score the roll.

Once you've scored the roll, you roll all the dice again and repeat the process.
You continue until all 13 categories have been filled, at which time the game is
over.
