Game consist of 13 rounds. In each round, player rolls 5 dice and then scores the roll in one of 13 categories. You can only score once in each category. The score is determined by a different rule for each category.

To start, roll dice by clicking “roll” button.  After you roll the dice you can either score the current roll, or preroll any or all of the five dice. 
To preroll some of the dice, click on the hold button beneath the die face you want to preroll, then click the "Roll Dice" button. This will preroll the selected dice, leaving the unselected ones unchanged.
